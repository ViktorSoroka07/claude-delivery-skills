# hook the JSON payload the harness sends it and asserts on the verdict; the
# commit-time tests build a throwaway repo with real staged content. Run from
# anywhere inside the repo; exits non-zero on any FAIL. Both hooks fail open,
# so an import or syntax error is invisible in a session - the smoke tests
# here are the only place such a break surfaces.
